# JERN (Json, Express, React, Node)
A "quick" full-stack experiment

## Features
- Server: RESTful API using NodeJS + Express
- Database: JSON file
- Client: React application (this is a modified version of [this app](https://github.com/bradtraversy/react_crash_todo))

## Setup
Install everything (as both projects were created separatedly and then put together for this repo)
```
cd .\server
npm install
cd ..\client
npm install
cd ..
```

## How to use it
Start the server by running
```
node .\server\main.js 
```
Start the client app by running

cd .\client
npm start
```
